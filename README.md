##This class serves as the controller for the "GamePane.fxml" file.
##It implements the Initializable interface, which requires the initialize method to be implemented. This method is invoked after all the FXML elements have been loaded.
##Inside the initialize method, it sets up the game environment, initializes brick health, creates the ball, creates bricks, creates the cannon, and launches balls.
##It contains methods like moveBall, checkBallCollision, createBricks, createCannon, launchBalls, checkBrickCollision, and updateHealthText, which handle various aspects of the game logic, including ball movement, collision detection, brick creation, cannon creation, ball launching, and brick health updating.
